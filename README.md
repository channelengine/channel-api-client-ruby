### Deprecation of the Channel API client libraries

This library is no longer supported by ChannelEngine. To build your own library via OpenAPI Generator, using your programming language of choice, check out the [Channel API: API clients](https://support.channelengine.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409515292317-ChannelEngine-REST-API-client-for-channels) article in our Help Center.

ChannelEngine’s APIs follow the OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, which you can find in our [API reference](https://demo.channelengine.net/api/swagger/index.html?urls.primaryName=ChannelEngine%20Channel%20API). (At the top of the swagger page switch to **'ChannelEngine Channel API'**)
